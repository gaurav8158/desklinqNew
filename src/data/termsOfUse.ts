      `You understand that the Membership has a monthly cycle (the “Cycle”), and that, unless otherwise agreed, the monthly Cycle applicable to the Service begins and renews as of the monthly calendar date on which the Service was initially acquired (e.g. if You acquire Service as of the 5th of the month, the Membership will last until the end of business on the 4th of the following month). Additional terms applicable to such Membership may be detailed on the Site. Each Membership will be valid for one calendar month, and can be used only to make reservations at Spaces on days Spaces are open and have available reservations.`,

Company may cancel your account and delete any unused Credits you may have accumulated after a period of time determined by Company in the course of resolving a billing issue. No refunds will be provided for unused Credits; any unused Credits are forfeited upon cancellation of Your Desklinq Membership.`,

If you are an individual you may opt out of this Arbitration Agreement within 30 days of the first of the date you access or use the Service by following the procedure described below.`,

      `Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court. There is no judge or jury in arbitration. Instead, the dispute is resolved by a neutral arbitrator. Court review of an arbitration award is limited. Except to the extent the parties agree otherwise, arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award. You agree that the U.S. Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision, and that you and Desklinq are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action, to the maximum extent permitted by law. This Arbitration Agreement will survive any termination of these Terms of Use.`,

      `If you intend to seek arbitration, after following the informal dispute resolution procedure, you must first send written notice to Desklinq of your intent to arbitrate (“Notice”). The Notice to Desklinq should be sent by emailing the Notice to hello@desklinq.com.`,

      `The Notice must (i) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (ii) set forth the specific relief sought. The arbitration will be administered by the International Institute for Conflict Prevention and Resolution (“CPR”) under the CPR Rules for Administered Arbitration by a single arbitrator. The arbitration will be conducted in the County of Cook, State of Illinois, United States.`,

      `Each party will be responsible for paying any CPR, administrative and arbitrator fees (other than the initial filing fees) in accordance with CPR Rules, except that Desklinq will pay for your reasonable filing, administrative, and arbitrator fees if your claim for damages does not exceed $75,000 and is non-frivolous (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)). Nothing in this Arbitration Agreement shall prevent either party from seeking injunctive or other equitable relief from the courts for matters related to data security, intellectual property, or unauthorized access to the Service.`,

      `If you do not want to arbitrate disputes with Desklinq and you are an individual, you may opt out of this Arbitration Agreement by sending an email to: hello@desklinq.com within 30 days of the first of the date you access or use the Service.`,

      `ALL CLAIMS MUST BE BROUGHT IN THE PARTIES’ INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS GUEST IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING, AND, UNLESS WE AGREE OTHERWISE, THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE PERSON'S CLAIMS. YOU AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THESE TERMS OF USE, YOU AND DESKLINQ ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION.`,

      `If the prohibition against class actions and other claims brought on behalf of third parties contained above is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this Arbitration Agreement will be null and void.`,

      `If for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration, the dispute will be governed exclusively and irrevocably by the laws of the State of Illinois and the FAA without regard to or application of its conflict of law provisions or your state or country of residence, and will be brought solely in the federal or state courts located in Cook County, Illinois, United States.
